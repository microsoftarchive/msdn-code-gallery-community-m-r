Description
This sample provides a simple Windows Mobile 6.5 application that demonstrates how to write an app to sync with a service that is created using Microsoft Sync Framework V4 October 2010 CTP service library. It accesses the same sample service as the Silverlight desktop and Windows Phone 7 samples, and synchronizes the same data (so data for the same user will flow between them!).

Warning:
In Settings.cs, change the URL for the SyncServiceURL and LoginURL properties to point to the sample service.

Prerequisites:
1.	Sample Service deployed in a location accessible to the client.
2.	Visual Studio 2008 with C# language components
3.	Windows Mobile 6 Professional and Standard SDK:  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=06111a3a-a651-4745-88ef-3d48091a390b&DisplayLang=en
