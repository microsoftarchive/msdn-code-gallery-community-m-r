MINOR CHANGES
- Socket type D and H compatibility check fixed
- Managed software I2C (used by DaisyLink) uses repeated start condition when appropriate
- Added StorageDevice.DeleteDirectory method and fixed StorageDevice.Delete to delete files

Version 2.42.600, 11 May 2012

MAJOR CHANGES
- NETMF 4.2 support added alongside NETMF 4.1 support
- Visual Basic apps supported in NETMF 4.2, using Visual Studio or Visual Basic 2010 Express

- For NETMF 4.2, GadgeteerCore's SPI, Serial and DaisyLink/SoftwareI2C features are split into separate DLLs so they can be left out to save RAM when not necessary.

MINOR CHANGES
- Bugfix in Gadgeteer.Interfaces.SPI

   i.e. if VC# Express is installed under where VS is, e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\ then it works OK.
- DaisyLink assigns global addresses but it could use per-bus addresses (normally one bus per socket) to increase total addressable devices

======================================================================

Version 2.41.500, 13 February 2012

MINOR CHANGES
- GTI.I2CBus bugfix to Read method
